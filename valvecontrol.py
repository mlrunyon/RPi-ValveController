Raspberry Pi Valve Control System

This module provides a comprehensive interface for controlling and monitoring laboratory
valves via [Raspberry Pi I^2C output]. It implements safety interlocks to prevent conflicting
valve states, handles system commands, and provides status monitoring capabilities.

Features:
- Individual valve control (open/close) with conflict prevention
- Batch operations (close all valves)
- System control commands (restart)
- Status reporting for monitoring
- Logging of all valve operations and errors

The module initializes [MOSFET channels via I^2C], defines valve configurations with their relationships,
and provides functions for valve manipulation through a consistent interface.

Dependencies:
- RPi.GPIO: For hardware control of GPIO pins
- threading.Timer: For delayed execution of commands
- logmanager: For operational logging
