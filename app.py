Valve Controller Web Application

A Flask-based web application for monitoring and controlling valves through a REST API.
This module serves as the main entry point and is designed to be run by Gunicorn.

Features:
- Web interface for valve status monitoring
- REST API for programmatic valve control with API key authentication
- System monitoring (CPU temperature, thread listing)
- Log viewing (application logs, Gunicorn logs, system logs)

The application exposes endpoints for valve control, system status, and log viewing.
